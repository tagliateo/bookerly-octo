# bookerly-octo

This program uses a HashMap to store the book titles as keys and their corresponding quantities as values. It uses a Scanner to read input from the user. The run method is the main loop of the program, which continuously prompts the user for input and performs the desired action based on their choice.

The addBooks, borrowBooks, and returnBooks methods are responsible for handling the respective actions. They prompt the user for input, update the book quantities accordingly, and display success or error messages as needed.

The main method creates an instance of the LibrarySystem class and starts the program by calling its run method.
